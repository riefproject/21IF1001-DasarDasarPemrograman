# Linguistic Materials

This folder contains theoretical materials and case studies related to the logical and linguistic foundation of programming. These materials aim to build a strong conceptual understanding before diving into pseudocode or programming languages like C.

## Content

### 1. Session 1: Kerangka Berpikir

-   Focuses on introducing the mindset required for programming, including sequential thinking and problem analysis.
-   **File**: [Kerangka Berpikir.pdf]

### 2. Session 2: Sequential and Conditional

-   Discusses how to organize actions sequentially and make decisions using conditions.
-   Includes case studies such as:
    -   Counting and sorting strawberry-flavored candies.
    -   Separating and counting candies by multiple flavors (strawberry, orange, grape).
    -   Identifying and categorizing different candy types.
-   **File**: [Session 2 - Sequential and Conditional.pdf]

### 3. Session 3: Iteration

-   Explores the concept of repetition in programming using iteration.
-   Covers various cases and scenarios, such as:
    -   Repeating actions to count and categorize candies.
    -   Practical examples of "while" and "do-while" loops represented in human-readable steps.
-   **File**: [Session 3 - Iteration.pdf]

## How to Use

1. **Understand the Concepts**:
    - Start with the provided PDF files to grasp the theoretical basis of sequential, conditional, and iterative processes.
2. **Apply to Programming**:
    - Use the knowledge from these materials to build pseudocode or implement logic in a programming language like C.

## Additional Notes

-   The examples in these sessions are designed to be practical and easy to follow, focusing on relatable case studies such as candy sorting.
-   These foundational concepts will serve as the basis for understanding more complex programming paradigms.
