# Pseudocode Materials

This folder contains pseudocode exercises and problem-solving examples from the Programming Basics course. These materials aim to bridge the theoretical concepts of programming logic to practical implementation.

## Content

### 1. Session 4: Iteration in Pseudocode

-   Explores the concept of iteration (looping) in programming logic.
-   Case studies include:
    -   Counting and moving colored balls into separate baskets.
    -   Sorting and counting candies based on flavors.
-   **File**: [Session 4 - Iteration in Pseudocode.pdf]

### 2. Session 5: Array

-   Focuses on single-dimensional arrays and their applications.
-   Case studies include:
    -   Counting odd numbers from a list.
    -   Identifying leap years from user input.
-   **File**: [Session 5 - Array.pdf]

### 3. Session 6: Multidimensional Array

-   Explores 2D arrays and their operations.
-   Case studies include:
    -   Summing two 3x3 matrices.
    -   Modifying matrix elements to follow specific patterns.
-   **File**: [Session 6 - Multidimensional Array.pdf]

### 4. Session 7: Composite Variables (Struct/Record)

-   Introduces composite data types like structs.
-   Case studies include:
    -   Storing and displaying student data (name, address, gender, domicile).
    -   Filtering students by age using a birth year attribute.
-   **File**: [Session 7 - Composite Variable.pdf]

## How to Use

1. **Study the Concepts**:
    - Review each session's pseudocode to understand the problem-solving logic.
2. **Practice Implementing**:
    - Translate the pseudocode into a programming language like C to deepen your understanding.

## Additional Notes

-   Each session builds on the previous one, starting from basic iterations to more complex data structures like structs and multidimensional arrays.
