# Root Repository - Programming Basics (21IF1001)

This repository consolidates all the materials, programs, and exercises from the Programming Basics course (**21IF1001**) at Politeknik Negeri Bandung (Polban). It includes theoretical materials, pseudocode exercises, and C programming implementations to provide a comprehensive learning journey.

## Repository Structure

### 1. [C Language](./C%20language/)

This folder contains all C programming implementations, including:

-   **Session 8**: Basic concepts like loops, arrays, and structs.
-   **Session 9**: Modular programming with functions.
-   **Session 10**: Real-world study cases such as string analysis and parking fee calculations.
-   **Session 11**: Abstract Data Types (ADTs) projects, including a Date System and Parking System.

### 2. [Linguistic Materials](./linguistic/)

Focuses on foundational programming logic, including:

-   Sequential and conditional structures.
-   Iteration concepts with real-world examples like candy sorting.

### 3. [Pseudocode](./pseudocode/)

Bridges theoretical concepts with practical problem-solving, featuring topics like:

-   Iteration.
-   Single and multidimensional arrays.
-   Composite variables (structs).

## How to Navigate

1. Each folder contains a dedicated `README.md` file with detailed explanations of its contents.
2. Study the theoretical materials in the `linguistic` and `pseudocode` folders before diving into C programming.
3. Explore session-wise C implementations to reinforce practical skills.

## How to Run C Programs

1. Navigate to the desired folder in the `C language` directory.
2. Compile the program using GCC or any compatible C compiler:
    ```bash
    gcc -o output_file_name filename.c
    ```
3. Execute the compiled file:
    ```bash
    ./output_file_name
    ```

## Key Learning Outcomes

-   **Programming Fundamentals**: Grasp essential concepts such as loops, conditionals, and arrays.
-   **Problem-Solving**: Apply theoretical knowledge to practical cases using pseudocode and C.
-   **Advanced Topics**: Understand modular programming and Abstract Data Types (ADTs).

## Additional Notes

-   Contributions and feedback are highly encouraged to improve this resource.
-   This repository is a great starting point for anyone new to programming or looking to strengthen their basics.
