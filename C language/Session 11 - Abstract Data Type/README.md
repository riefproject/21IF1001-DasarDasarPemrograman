# Session 11 - Abstract Data Types (ADTs)

This parent folder contains implementations of various Abstract Data Types (ADTs) as part of Session 11. Each ADT demonstrates modular programming principles, focusing on real-world applications to solidify understanding of abstraction and encapsulation in C/C++.

## Content

### 1. [Prob1 - ADT Date System](./Prob1%20-%20ADT%20Date%20System/)

-   **Description**: An ADT for managing date operations, including creating, validating, and calculating differences between dates.
-   **Features**:
    -   Date creation and validation.
    -   Leap year detection.
    -   Previous and next date calculations.
    -   Date difference computation.
-   **File Structure**:
    -   Includes `date.h` (header file) and `date.cpp` (implementation).

### 2. [Prob2 - ADT Parking System](./Prob2%20-%20ADT%20Parking%20System/)

-   **Description**: An ADT for managing a parking system that calculates fees based on vehicle type and duration.
-   **Features**:
    -   Fee calculation based on specific rules.
    -   Input validation for vehicle type and duration.
    -   User-friendly menu for interactions.
-   **File Structure**:
    -   Includes `parkingsys.h` (header file) and `parkingsys.c` (implementation).

## How to Navigate

-   Each subfolder (`Prob1` and `Prob2`) contains a dedicated `README.md` file that provides a detailed overview of the respective ADT, its features, and instructions for execution.
-   Use the provided `makefile` in each folder to compile and run the programs.

## Key Learning Outcomes

-   **Modular Programming**: Each ADT is implemented with a focus on modularity, promoting reusable and maintainable code.
-   **Encapsulation**: Data and operations are encapsulated within structs, with clearly defined getter and setter functions.
-   **Real-World Applications**: Both ADTs are designed to solve practical problems, making the concepts relatable and applicable.

## Additional Notes

-   These implementations serve as a foundational exercise in designing and utilizing ADTs in programming.
-   Contributions and suggestions for improvements are welcome.
