# Prob1 - ADT Date System

This folder contains a comprehensive date management system implemented as an Abstract Data Type (ADT) using the C++ programming language. The focus is on modular and reusable designs, highlighting the application of ADTs in real-world problems.

## File Structure

-   **Main Program**:

    -   `mdate.cpp`: The main program demonstrating the use of the ADT Date system.
    -   `makefile`: Build script for compiling the program.
    -   `DateSystem.exe`: Executable file (if supported by your system).

-   **Include Files**:

    -   `date.h`: Header file defining the ADT and its associated functions.
    -   `boolean.h`: Header file defining the `boolean` type for use in the ADT.

-   **Library Files**:
    -   `date.cpp`: Implementation of the ADT Date functions.

## Features

1. **Date Operations**:
    - Create default or user-defined dates.
    - Validate dates against calendar rules.
2. **Relational Operators**:
    - Compare dates (e.g., check if one date is before another).
3. **Advanced Features**:
    - Compute the difference in days between two dates.
    - Find the previous or next date.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to this folder.
2. Compile the program using the `make` command:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
3. Run the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./DateSystem
    ```

## Additional Notes

-   This ADT Date System demonstrates the power of abstraction and modular programming in C++.
-   The program includes robust input validation to ensure user-friendly operation.
