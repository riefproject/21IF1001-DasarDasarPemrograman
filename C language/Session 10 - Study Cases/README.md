# Session 10 - Study Cases

This folder contains study case programs designed to solve real-world problems using the C programming language. Each program focuses on specific practical applications and emphasizes logical problem-solving skills.

## Content

### 1. [Prob1 - Display Vowels and Consonants](./Prob1%20-%20TampilkanHurufVokalDanKonsonan.c)

-   **Description**: Analyzes a string inputted by the user (up to 50 characters) to count and display vowels and consonants separately in ascending order.
-   **Key Concepts**: String manipulation, loops, and sorting.

### 2. [Prob2 - Count Vowels and Consonants](./Prob2%20-%20HitungHurufVokalDanKonsonan.c)

-   **Description**: Reads a string inputted by the user and calculates the total number of vowels and consonants.
-   **Key Concepts**: String traversal and character classification.

### 3. [Prob3 - Parking System](./Prob3%20-%20SistemParkir.c)

-   **Description**: Simulates a parking fee calculation system based on the type of vehicle (motorcycle or car) and the duration of parking.
    -   Fee structure:
        | Vehicle Type | First Hour | Subsequent Hours |
        |--------------|------------|------------------|
        | Motorcycle | 1000 | 1500 |
        | Car | 3000 | 3500 |
-   **Key Concepts**: Conditional logic, user input validation, and arithmetic operations.

## How to Run

1. Open the desired `.c` file in a C-compatible IDE or text editor.
2. Compile the file using a C compiler such as GCC:
    ```bash
    gcc -o output_file_name filename.c
    ```
3. Run the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./output_file_name
    ```

## Additional Notes

-   These study cases are designed to reinforce understanding of string manipulation, conditional logic, and practical problem-solving in C.
-   Each program provides a user-friendly interface and handles basic input validation.
-   For any questions or discussions, feel free to open an issue or reach out via GitHub.
