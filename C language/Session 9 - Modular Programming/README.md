# Session 9 - Modular Programming

This folder contains programs and solutions that implement modular programming concepts in the C language. These programs focus on breaking down complex problems into smaller, reusable functions to promote code organization and reusability.

These implementations are based on:

-   **Session 6**: Multidimensional arrays and their operations.
-   **Session 7**: Composite variables (structs) and data organization.

## Content

### Programs Based on Session 6: Multidimensional Arrays

1. [Session6-Prob1.c](./Session6-Prob1.c)

    - **Description**: Adds two 3x3 matrices entered by the user and displays the resulting matrix.
    - **Key Concepts**: Modular functions, multidimensional arrays, and arithmetic operations.

2. [Session6-Prob2.c](./Session6-Prob2.c)

    - **Description**: Subtracts two 3x3 matrices entered by the user and displays the resulting matrix.
    - **Key Concepts**: Modular functions, multidimensional arrays, and arithmetic operations.

3. [Session6-Prob3.c](./Session6-Prob3.c)
    - **Description**: Manipulates a 5x5 matrix by initializing with zeros, modifying diagonals, and replacing other values with specific numbers.
    - **Key Concepts**: Matrix manipulation, modular functions, and conditional updates.

### Programs Based on Session 7: Composite Variables

4. [Session7-Prob1.c](./Session7-Prob1.c)

    - **Description**: Stores and displays data of 10 students (name, address, gender, and domicile).
    - **Key Concepts**: Structs, modular functions, and data organization.

5. [Session7-Prob2.c](./Session7-Prob2.c)
    - **Description**: Extends the previous program to include birth year and calculates the number of students older than 20.
    - **Key Concepts**: Structs, modular functions, and conditional logic.

## How to Run

1. Open the desired `.c` file in a C-compatible IDE or text editor.
2. Compile the file using a C compiler such as GCC:
    ```bash
    gcc -o output_file_name filename.c
    ```
3. Run the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./output_file_name
    ```

## Additional Notes

-   These programs emphasize the use of modular programming to improve code readability and maintainability.
-   Each program showcases a specific use case of modularity combined with arrays, structs, and conditionals to enhance understanding.
-   For any questions or discussions, feel free to open an issue or reach out via GitHub.
