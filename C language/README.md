# C Language - Programming Basics Repository

This root folder contains all the programs, study cases, and Abstract Data Type (ADT) implementations from the Programming Basics course using the C programming language. The content is divided into sessions to represent different learning milestones, starting from basic syntax and structures to advanced modular programming and ADTs.

## Folder Structure

### 1. [Session 8 - Basic C Language](./Session%208/)

-   **Description**: Introduces basic concepts of C programming, including loops, conditionals, and arrays.
-   **Key Topics**:
    -   Iteration (while, do-while, for loops).
    -   Single and multidimensional arrays.
    -   Basic struct usage.

### 2. [Session 9 - Modular Programming](./Session%209/)

-   **Description**: Focuses on breaking down problems into smaller, reusable functions to promote code organization.
-   **Key Topics**:
    -   Modular design using functions.
    -   Multidimensional arrays and struct operations.

### 3. [Session 10 - Study Cases](./Session%2010/)

-   **Description**: Real-world problems implemented in C to reinforce logical problem-solving skills.
-   **Key Cases**:
    -   Vowel and consonant analysis in strings.
    -   Parking fee calculation system.

### 4. [Session 11 - Abstract Data Types (ADTs)](./Session%2011/)

-   **Description**: Explores the use of Abstract Data Types to design modular and reusable systems.
-   **Key Projects**:
    -   ADT Date System for managing dates.
    -   ADT Parking System for calculating parking fees.

## How to Navigate

Each session folder contains a `README.md` file that provides detailed explanations about its contents, including program descriptions, key concepts, and instructions for running the programs. The `makefile` in each project simplifies the compilation process.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the desired session or project folder.
2. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
    ```bash
    gcc -o output_file_name filename.c
    ```
3. Run the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./output_file_name
    ```

## Key Learning Outcomes

-   **Basic Syntax**: Understand fundamental constructs like loops, conditionals, and arrays.
-   **Modular Design**: Learn to organize code into smaller, reusable functions.
-   **Abstract Data Types**: Apply encapsulation and abstraction for building scalable systems.

## Additional Notes

-   This repository is a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing C programming.
-   Contributions and feedback to enhance the content are always welcome.
