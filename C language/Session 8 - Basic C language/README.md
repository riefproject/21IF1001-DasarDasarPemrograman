# Session 8 - Basic C Language

This folder contains programs and solutions that translate the theoretical concepts covered in Sessions 4 to 7 into practical implementations using the C programming language. The programs demonstrate the use of loops, conditional statements, and arrays to solve a variety of problems.

These implementations are based on:

-   **Session 4**: Concepts of iteration (while, do-while, and for loops).
-   **Session 5**: Arrays and basic data handling.
-   **Session 6**: Multidimensional arrays and operations.
-   **Session 7**: Composite variables (structs) and data organization.

## Content

### Programs Based on Session 4: Iteration

1. [Session4-Prob1.c](./Session4-Prob1.c)

    - **Description**: Moves and counts the number of red balls from a basket of mixed colors.
    - **Key Concepts**: While loops, arrays, and string handling.

2. [Session4-Prob2-WhileLoop.c](./Session4-Prob2-WhileLoop.c)

    - **Description**: Separates and counts balls based on their colors using a `while` loop.
    - **Key Concepts**: Iteration, arrays, and string comparisons.

3. [Session4-Prob2-DoWhile.c](./Session4-Prob2-DoWhile.c)

    - **Description**: Similar to the `while` loop version but implemented with a `do-while` loop.
    - **Key Concepts**: Alternative looping structures.

4. [Session4-Prob2-ForLoop.c](./Session4-Prob2-ForLoop.c)
    - **Description**: Implements the same logic as above using a `for` loop.
    - **Key Concepts**: Comparison of looping techniques.

### Programs Based on Session 5: Arrays

5. [Session5-Prob1.c](./Session5-Prob1.c)

    - **Description**: Counts the number of odd numbers entered by the user.
    - **Key Concepts**: Array traversal and conditionals.

6. [Session5-Prob2.c](./Session5-Prob2.c)

    - **Description**: Identifies leap years from a set of user-inputted years.
    - **Key Concepts**: Logical operators and conditional checks.

7. [Session5-Prob3.c](./Session5-Prob3.c)

    - **Description**: Displays a sequence of repeated numbers in a grid format.
    - **Key Concepts**: Nested loops and iteration.

8. [Session5-Prob4.c](./Session5-Prob4.c)
    - **Description**: Generates a triangular number pattern based on user input.
    - **Key Concepts**: Nested loops and dynamic termination conditions.

### Programs Based on Session 6: Multidimensional Arrays

9. [Session6-Prob1.c](./Session6-Prob1.c)

    - **Description**: Adds two 3x3 matrices entered by the user and displays the resulting matrix.
    - **Key Concepts**: Multidimensional arrays and arithmetic operations.

10. [Session6-Prob2.c](./Session6-Prob2.c)

    - **Description**: Subtracts two 3x3 matrices entered by the user and displays the resulting matrix.
    - **Key Concepts**: Multidimensional arrays and arithmetic operations.

11. [Session6-Prob3.c](./Session6-Prob3.c)
    - **Description**: Manipulates a 5x5 matrix by initializing with zeros, modifying diagonals, and replacing other values with specific numbers.
    - **Key Concepts**: Matrix manipulation and conditional updates.

### Programs Based on Session 7: Composite Variables

12. [Session7-Prob1.c](./Session7-Prob1.c)

    -   **Description**: Stores and displays data of 10 students (name, address, gender, and domicile).
    -   **Key Concepts**: Structs and data organization.

13. [Session7-Prob2.c](./Session7-Prob2.c)
    -   **Description**: Extends the previous program to include birth year and calculates the number of students older than 20.
    -   **Key Concepts**: Structs, arrays, and conditional logic.

## How to Run

1. Open the desired `.c` file in a C-compatible IDE or text editor.
2. Compile the file using a C compiler such as GCC:
    ```bash
    gcc -o output_file_name filename.c
    ```
3. Run the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./output_file_name
    ```

## Additional Notes

-   These programs are designed to provide hands-on experience with basic C programming constructs.
-   Each program highlights a specific use case of loops, arrays, and conditionals to strengthen understanding.
